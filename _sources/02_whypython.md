# Why Python? üêç
The first question that comes to mind might be: why use Python and not one of the other, just as well documented, free programming languages? Generally speaking it doesn‚Äôt matter too much what programming language you use as long as it get‚Äôs the job done. However, there are features that make Python a great first programming language as well as features that make Python an awesome programming language in science, web development and geodesy and geoinformatics. 

## Versatility and popularity üëç
The main reason is the versatility and ease of use of Python. Python enables developers to write small, powerful scripts to automate tasks as well as writing complex applications for the Command Line Interface (CLI) or Terminal as well as graphical user interface (GUI) applications, games and frameworks that power enterprise applications. Also Python is, according to [statista](https://www.statista.com/chart/21017/most-popular-programming-languages/), the most popular programming language with a yearly upwards trend of 4.1 %. The popularity also shows in the community support which is very apparent when looking at the available libraries and packages around Python.


## What elements does Python use? üß©
Before we take a look at the installation of Python on our systems, we take a look at an overview of the elements Python is using. We will take a more in-depth look at the elements over the course of the semester. 

Python code usually consists of the following elements:
* assignments
* comments
* conditions
* functions
* input and output
* loops
* operators
* variables

We will talk about all those elements when the time is right. First we need to get Python running on our system!
