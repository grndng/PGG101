# Starting Off üåü
When trying to learn a new programming language (in case you don‚Äôt have any previous experience), starting by zero isn‚Äôt easy. There are a lot of resources which can be overwhelming by itself and you need to wrap your head around a lot of new concepts.

As you know by now, at HafenCity University, we‚Äôre using [Python](https://www.python.org/) as the tool of our trade. Python will most probably not solve every difficulty on your way to your Masters Degree but is one of the most versatile tools and entrenched in Geomatics and the Data Science accompanied by the tasks of Geodesy and Geoinformatics.

Before jumping into the world of Python there are a few ideas and concepts we want to talk about to make it easier for you to a) learn Python in a sustainable manner and not forget about what you‚Äôve learned after one week since you‚Äôll need it over the course of your masters programme and b) point you in directions to re-learn certain things because Python, as a lot of other programming languages, is being developed constantly.

> **Consistency is key** ‚õÖ Since consistency means to write and read code regularly, this seems obvious. However, coding daily will help you to learn fast, train your muscle memory as well as finish projects in time. There are a lot of online resources full of small and meaningful problems to solve each day without spending your whole afternoon!


> **Take notes** üìì Taking notes when programming is just as valid as for every other thing you do in your masters programme. At first, code will be basic and self explanatory but the deeper you dive into Python you will notice that your code gets more complicated. Functions you don‚Äôt use regularly might be worth summarizing in your own words to deepen your understanding of them and documenting what you are doing. Taking notes sometimes also reveals patterns that are important to get a better understanding of Python and the tasks we are trying to solve.


> **Practice** üê¢ Practice makes perfect and acquiring knowledge and methods to solve problems is affected by engagement in deliberate practice. Deliberate practice involves attention and rehearsal as well as repetition. Going over a solved task again will reinforce your understanding of the method used to solve the problem which, in turn, will lead to more complex knowledge and problem solving skills.
