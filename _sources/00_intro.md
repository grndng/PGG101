# Python for Geodesy and Geoinformatics 101
Welcome to PGG101, the preparatory course for Python in Geodesy and Geoinformatics at HCU!

## PGG 101
Python for Geodesy and Geoinformatics 101 is a preparatory course for the programming language Python which is being used in the bachelor’s and master’s program Geodesy and Geoinformatics at HafenCity University. Especially if you don’t have any prior knowledge of Python or other programming languages, you should work through the preparatory course carefully. The course is designed so that you can learn the basics of Python in a concise manner. It is by no means complete or a full introduction into programming or Python and meant as preparation for the master’s program at HafenCity University.

## Before we start: what this course is not
This course is not meant to be a complete guide on all the things you can do with Python. The different sections describe roughly what to expect from each chapter. We try to be as beginner friendly as possible so in case you already have some experience in Python or if you have experience in another programming language, you might want to skip sections. In case you’re coming from another programming language, you might check out resources on moving from e.g. Java to Python. We expect you, and we will keep expecting you, to look for resources independently as well since programming takes training and time to learn properly and sustainably. In case you have specific questions or need further input on Python, also feel free to ask your instructors outside of Software and Interface Technology as well!

## How to navigate?
The PGG101-website is mainly split into three parts. On the left side you can see the table of contents (toc) of the entire "book". There you can see, for example, "Python for Geodesy and Geoinformatics 101" which is the chapter you are currently reading. Right in the middle you simply find the content which is what you are currently reading. On the right side you see another table of contents, which, contrary to the toc on the left side, shows the subscetions (or "subchapters") of the chapter you are currently reading.
